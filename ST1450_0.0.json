  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the art market industry, as part of a team delivering sales. An art market coordinator may be employed by galleries, auction houses or art dealers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to use specialist knowledge and expertise in art history and research to co-ordinate the selling of artworks in and across the art market with relevant stakeholders. They can work across all art market environments such as galleries, auction houses, and dealers. These may include offices, studios, showrooms, warehouses, art fairs or a combination of these. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with departmental specialists and wider operational teams. They also work with legal and finance departments to provide relevant information on artworks and complete a transaction from end to end. To facilitate sales they liaise with clients, internal colleagues and external stakeholders in the UK or internationally. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for managing the operational elements of art sales, whether that be in the form of art market auctions (live or online), private sales or ‘buy it now’. This will require specialist knowledge and skills in art history and aesthetics to appropriately coordinate logistics, compliance, negotiation, deal making, client services and marketing and research. Roles and responsibilities may vary from organisation to organisation depending on the size of the employer, the specific method of selling and the nature of the artworks involved.&lt;/p&gt;",
