  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the Aerospace sector. Aerospace engineering technicians act as enablers for the full lifecycle of an aerospace product. They support the work of Aerospace engineers, following their processes and procedures. They could be part of the design, production, inspection, testing or maintenance process. They work on the design, manufacture and operation of aircraft, missiles, satellites and space vehicles. They may specialise in building and maintaining aircraft systems and components. For example, the fuselage, wings, engines, landing gear, brakes, flying controls and environmental systems. Others may install and test electrical and electronic systems. These systems are used in navigation, communications and flight control. Employers vary in size from small to large.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a core and options apprenticeship standard. Apprentices will complete the core requirements, plus one option:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 1. Aerospace technical support technician.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 2. Aerospace fitting technician.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 3. Aerospace machining technician&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of this occupation is to produce or test new and existing aerospace products, processes, or procedures. They review and interpret aerospace engineering information and data. They complete documentation, review work processes and outcomes. They keep stakeholders informed and contribute to problem solving activities, audits and projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aerospace technical support technicians contribute to process and procedure development. They inspect, test or validate products and processes. They investigate and review designs and produce technical reports and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aerospace fitting technicians load, adjust and set machinery jigs or fixtures. They validate manufacturing programmes, operate equipment and produce aerospace assemblies.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aerospace machining technicians load, adjust and set machining fixtures and materials. They validate machining programmes, operate equipment and produce machined components.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aerospace engineering technicians typically work in both a manufacturing and office environment. Depending on the organisation, they may also be required to work outdoors. Aerospace technicians may be required to work shifts and work at height.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other Aerospace technicians and Aerospace engineers. They may also interact with customers, suppliers, colleagues, quality auditors and regulators. They typically report to an engineering or manufacturing team leader. This can be as part of a defined or cross-functional team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the quality, safety and delivery of the product or support being provided. They must produce or deliver the product or support on time, at agreed cost. They must produce accurate certified work to Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Aerospace regulatory requirements. They work to defined quality processes and procedures. They must identify and contribute to making improvements. For example, to improve business processes procedures, ways and methods of working. They must work both individually and as part of a larger team. They must work within the health, safety, sustainability and environmental regulations. They must use appropriate protective clothing and equipment. They must use and maintain machinery, tools and equipment correctly. All work must be completed in a safe and efficient manner as directed by supervisory staff.&lt;/p&gt;",
