  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in large and small organisations in the independent, charity and public healthcare sectors in the UK. Osteopaths are highly trained to practise autonomously from the point of registration. This means people can seek care directly from an osteopath without requiring a referral from another professional. Osteopathy is a protected title, and osteopaths are statutorily regulated by law. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to evaluate, diagnose and manage patient care needs relating to the entire musculoskeletal (MSK) system and the MSK system&#39;s relationship with other body systems. This often includes managing complex and challenging presentations, the treatment of which benefits from taking a biopsychosocial approach. Osteopaths work with people of all ages and their families and carers to provide person-centred, holistic packages of care, the nature of which varies according to the individual needs and preferences of the person being treated. Osteopathic practice includes the use of palpation and manual therapy, as well as rehabilitation exercises, self-management, screening and general health promotion advice. While holding expertise in MSK health, osteopaths often undertake post-registration education to expand their contribution to meeting the needs of specific patient groups, including children, older people and animals. They may also undertake speciality roles in orthopaedics, rheumatology, occupational health, sports medicine, pelvic health and chronic pain management. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, osteopaths interact with patients and their families and carers and with other healthcare professionals such as doctors, midwives, and other healthcare professionals. The link with researchers and educators a well as with their professional regulator and professional body, as an integral part of their professional activity. They may develop in how they practise as an osteopath by becoming a researcher, educator or business owner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Osteopaths are responsible for practising as autonomous practitioners who exercise their professional judgement and are accountable for their professional decisions and actions. They deliver individualised, person-centred care based on holistic assessment, shared goal setting, decision making and ongoing review. They provide osteopathic care via manual therapy, therapeutic exercise and rehabilitation, and clinical advice. They are responsible for managing a patient caseload, including through effective record keeping.&lt;/p&gt;",
