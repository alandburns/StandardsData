  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation Overview: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well designed and enforced regulation plays a vital role in improving the way markets work for the benefit of business, employees and citizens, supporting sustainable growth, trade and investment and improved social and environmental outcomes. It is well recognised that the regulatory climate is a key contributor to the creation of a positive and supportive business environment whilst also assuring public and environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Profile: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within the public sector, Compliance Officers either work to perform regulatory services functions within local authorities such as environmental health, fire safety, licensing or trading standards but may also work within monitoring compliance teams within national regulators such as the Food Standards Agency (FSA), Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Department for the Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) or the Register of Regulated Qualifications (OFqual). In the private sector officers will typically be involved in supporting compliance activities within a range of businesses and liaising with frontline regulators. Additionally officers will provide monitoring and oversight of the compliance related activities of the wider supply chain to assure product and process quality and safety as well as legality. Typical activities that may be carried out by a fully competent employee include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assessing the extent to which a business meets the requirements of the law and/or relevant audit standards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working with businesses to help them comply with relevant legislation in their sector and/or meet the requirements of private standards e.g. International Organisation for Standardisations (ISO)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Providing information, guidance and advice to businesses on how to comply with legislation or meet audit requirements in their sectors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collecting and analysing business data to build a picture of business compliance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conducting risk assessments and highlighting hazards which may result in non compliance by the business&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Auditing and monitoring business compliance in relation to the regulations which apply to a specific sector&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Writing reports following inspections or audits&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Liaising with businesses/regulators to resolve any issues of non-compliance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Managing relationships with businesses and providing customer service&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dealing with complaints from consumers and other businesses and
