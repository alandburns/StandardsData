  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p class=&quot;pf0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cf0&quot;&gt;This occupation is found in a wide range of sectors and organisations that rely on digital tools, online systems, and data-driven processes to operate efficiently. Employees in this occupation support improvement wherever digital workflows exist and are typically embedded in operational teams, working in digital support roles, or in change delivery functions. They may also be employed by consultancies or service providers helping organisations optimise internal and customer-facing processes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;pf0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cf0&quot;&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to enhance productivity, streamline processes, and support continuous improvement through the safe and responsible use of automation, integration, and AI tools. They understand, select, and implement digital solutions to address inefficiencies in existing systems. Their work is focused on solving real-world challenges that slow down business operations such as manual tasks, duplicated data entry, unintegrated tools, and inefficient workflows. They play a key role in unlocking time and cost savings supporting organisations to realise the potential for AI, automation and digital solutions to improve efficiency, accuracy or productivity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;pf0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cf0&quot;&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with internal stakeholders across a variety of teams such as operations, service delivery, customer support, or finance, depending on the organisation. They may also engage with external suppliers or digital tool providers to implement new systems or assist with integrations. They report to team leaders, service managers or project owners and work closely with colleagues to analyse and support existing ways of working. They use communication, collaboration, and feedback skills to align their automation work with wider organisational goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;pf0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cf0&quot;&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for identifying opportunities to improve workflow efficiency and productivity using digital tools. They will analyse current systems and processes, make recommendations utilising low-or no-code solutions including AI-driven automations. They will support with user adoption, facilitating the responsible, safe and ethical use of AI, automation and digital solutions, ensuring they align with organisational policies and user needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;pf0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cf0&quot;&gt;While they are not expected to lead teams, they are responsible for taking ownership of specific projects or tasks that deliver tangible operational value.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
