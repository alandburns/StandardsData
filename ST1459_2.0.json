  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in professional firms in accountancy or law, commercial organisations and the public sector such as local authorities and central government. All organisations and individuals that are liable to taxation may interact with people in this occupation where they require advice on their taxation position.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to help organisations and individuals achieve their financial goals and comply with the tax requirements in the UK and potentially internationally. Chartered Taxation Advisors may specialise in a particular branch of taxation. These could advise companies on corporate taxes. They may advise businesses on income tax, VAT and other indirect taxes or employment tax. They may specialise in particular aspects of tax reliefs such as Research and Development, international tax or capital allowances. If specialising in helping individuals they may become a personal tax specialist. They may advise on tax efficient wealth management, capital gains tax and inheritance tax. They may work as a tax advisor on their own or with a professional firm. They may work in local authorities or public bodies such as the NHS working on employment taxes and VAT. They may work in estates planning alongside lawyers to ensure an efficient and smooth transfer of assets between generations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with stakeholders such as clients or internal teams within an organisation. They also work closely with His Majesty&#39;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to ensure that tax obligations are met and queries raised or resolved in a timely way. They may interact with other public bodies such as Land Registry depending on the taxes concerned. They may also interact with financial institutions, legal teams and the courts and tribunals system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for interpreting and explaining current and new tax legislation to non-technical stakeholders such as clients or leaders and managers within an organisation. They keep up to date with changes, looking for new ways to effectively apply new legislation and scanning for risks and opportunities for their stakeholders. Chartered Taxation Advisors are highly focused on meeting deadlines to ensure that taxation returns are made on time and accurately. They analyse data in real time and may interact with real time tax dashboards and visualisation techniques to evaluate and explain opportunities to stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;",
