The Level 2 Adult Social Care Certificate qualification is an Ofqual regulated qualification, requiring observational assessment and is expected to take a new learner around 6-8 months to complete. An experienced care worker may complete this in a shorter period of time. The qualification is available now to eligible non-regulated care staff, 16+ years.",
