  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a variety of settings where teaching is delivered to pupils between the ages of 3-19. This includes maintained schools, academies, specialist schools, faith schools, and private schools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A teacher’s primary role is to plan and deliver a high-quality curriculum to their pupils to promote good progress and outcomes. Teachers set high expectations which inspire and challenge pupils and manage behaviour effectively to ensure a safe learning environment. Teachers make accurate and productive use of assessment and adapt their teaching to respond to pupils’ needs. They will have strong subject knowledge and keep their teaching practice up to date through regular professional development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A teacher&#39;s day will look different depending on the type of school they work in and the subject they teach. Each school will have its own timetable and different responsibilities outside of teaching hours. In their daily work, a teacher interacts with children, young people, parents and carers. They will work with the senior leadership team in their school, led by a headteacher or head of school. They interact with teaching colleagues and pastoral and curriculum leads. They will also work closely with specialists such as the special educational needs coordinator and designated safeguarding leads.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A teacher will be responsible for upholding the Teachers&#39; Standards, which set the minimum requirements for teachers&#39; practice and conduct. Teachers demonstrate consistently high standards of personal and professional conduct. They are responsible for safeguarding and must follow statutory guidance set out in &#39;Keeping Children Safe in Education&#39;. This includes safeguarding pupils&#39; wellbeing. Teachers are responsible for the pupils in their care. They typically report to a subject or year group coordinator in the first instance, with the headteacher having overall responsibility. Qualified teacher status (QTS) is a legal requirement to teach in maintained schools and is considered desirable for teachers in the majority of schools in England.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices must meet the entry requirements for initial teacher training (ITT) as set out by the Department for Education (DfE): Initial teacher training (ITT): criteria and supporting advice - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In line with other ITT routes, entry requirements for the teacher apprenticeship require apprentices to have achieved a standard equivalent to a grade 4 in the GCSE examinations in English and mathematics; and ensure that those who intend to train to teach pupils aged 3 to 11 additionally have achieved a standard equivalent to a grade 4 in the GCSE examination in a science subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Where applicants do not have a relevant GCSE at grade 4 or an equivalent qualification, ITT providers can allow them to demonstrate they meet this entry requirement by taking a GCSE equivalency test.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Occupation duties&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: normal; mso-outline-level: 3; background: white; vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The below sets out the standards that define the minimum level of practice for trainees and teachers to achieve Qualified Teacher Status - and which all apprentices will be assessed against.
